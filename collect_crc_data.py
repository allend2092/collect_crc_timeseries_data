'''
Add code to handle errors and exceptions. You should include error handling code to handle any exceptions that may occur
 during the execution of the script. For example, you may want to catch exceptions related to SSH connections, command
  execution, JSON parsing, or data parsing, and log the errors to a file or send an alert.

Test the script and debug any issues. You can use a test environment to verify that the script is working as expected
 and debug any issues that may arise.
